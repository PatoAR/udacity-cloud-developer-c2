# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

This is the submission code for the Image Filtering app project in Part 3 of Udacity's Cloud Developer Nanodegree.
I had a problem making work the deleteLocalFiles function, with the following error:
 // deleteLocalFiles(filteredpath);
 // I am having a problem with this part, it says "Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string[]'."
Tried to look for solutions but could not find one, so decided to submit it anyway.
